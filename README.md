## Don't understand Jekyll

So there's no editing of the .html pages themselves, only content interaction via .md files?

### Struggling to properly forward www subdomain

it's currently redirecting to the apex domain (as it should), but also changing the url accordingly (to willacai.com), whereas I want the url to remain static (www.willacai.com).

### Support or Contact

should I make a ko-fi account
